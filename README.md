# Portfolio-OIBSIP
excited to share that I had successfully completed my level 1 #task2 project to create a portfolio using HTML and CSS during my internship at Oasis Infobyte is a valuable accomplishment. A portfolio is an excellent way to showcase own skills and projects to potential employers or clients. It demonstrates your own proficiency in front-end web development and highlights creativity and attention to detail.
While creating portfolio using HTML and CSS, likely had the opportunity to design and structure various web pages, incorporate different elements such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and content sections, and apply styling and formatting using CSS to make the portfolio visually appealing and user-friendly.
Building a portfolio not only helps us to gain practical experience in web development but also allows to compile best work and present it in a professional manner. It can serve as a powerful tool for future job applications and can be continuously updated as you complete more projects or gain new skills.
